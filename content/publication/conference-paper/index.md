  The fronto-parietal network (FPN) is crucial for cognitively demanding tasks
  as it

  selectively represents task-relevant information and controls other brain regions. To

  implement these functions, it has been argued that it is a flexible hub that

  reconfigures its functional connectivity with other networks. This was supported by

  a study in which a set of demanding tasks were presented, that varied in their sensory features, comparison rules, and response mappings, and the FPN showed

  greater reconfiguration of functional connectivity between tasks than any other network. However, this task set was designed to engage the FPN, and therefore it

  remains an open question whether the FPN is in a flexible hub in general or only for

  such task sets. Using two freely available datasets (Experiment 1, N = 15, Experiment

  2, N = 644), we examined dynamic functional connectivity during naturalistic cognition, while participants watched a movie. Many differences in the flexibility were

  found across networks but the FPN was not the most flexible hub in the brain, during

  either movie for any of two measures, using a regression model or a correlation

  model and across five timescales. We, therefore, conclude that the FPN does not

  have the trait of being a flexible hub, although it may adopt this state for particular

  task sets.
